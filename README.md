# News-Scraper

News-Scraper is a full stack website that allows visitors to view articles from scraped from NPR (http://npr.org), save specific articles, and add/delete comments about saved articles. The following technologies were used for this site:

* Node/Express for server and routing,
* MongoDB for the database,
* Mongoose for the models,
* cheerio for scraping, and
* handlebars to render the content to the page.
